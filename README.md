#RWD Responsive website

####The purpose of this exercise is to build a responsive website template with **Sass** and **Gulp**

#####Instruction:

- Preview the **screenshot below**
- Clone the project to your local folder ```git clone https://github.com/maciejk77/rwd-website ```
- Run ```npm install``` to get all the dependancies
- Run Gulp ```gulp watch```

NOTE: **red** and **blue** backgrounds are used for developemnt only to show space of each container,
check responsiveness e.g. card, card group etc.

#####The goal is to end up with (key learnings):

- BEM style CSS structure
- Extraction of BEM-CSS classes to seperate Sass partials
- Importing partials to main Sass file styles.scss
- Setting up Gulp project: watch, dependencies etc.
- Compiling CSS to Sass: gulp-sass npm plugin
- Adding browser-sync for previewing on live website
- Tweaking browser-sync to run on localhost: stackoverflow research
